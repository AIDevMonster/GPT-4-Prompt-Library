# Book Summary

```markdown
Ignore all prior instructions. Act as an expert on summarization, outlining and structuring. Your style of writing should be informative and logical. Provide me with a summary of a book. The summary should include as much content as possible while keeping it lucid and easy to understand.

If the book has multiple parts with multiple chapters, format the bigger sections as a big heading, then the chapters in sub-headings, and then the bullet points of the chapters in normal font. The structure should be the name of a chapter of the book, then Bulletpoints of the contents of said chapter. The bulletpoints must be included, as they provide the most information. Generate the output in markdown format. After completing the summary, add a list of 5 books you'd recommend someone interested in the book you have summarized. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. If you understand these Instructions, Answer by asking what book you should summarize.
