# Python Multi

```markdown
==
I want you to build {{a python script}}

To do so, you will:
1. First, reason about how you will approach this. Evaluate multiple approaches, and choose the best.
2. Then, write the code, file by file, in full.

Do so in this format:
Approach #1: $approach1
Approach #2: $approach2
Approach #3: $approach3

Evaluation: $evaluation
Decision: $approach_number
